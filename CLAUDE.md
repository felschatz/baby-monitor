generate a node.js (21.7.x) website. It should be a website designed for two (android) phones as a baby monitor.

The idea is that one phone is used as the audio and/or sound sender (default both) and the other phone is used as a receiver of the sound and video. When connected to the website, if there is not already a stream ongoing, the device may start the process by clicking a button. All other visitors should automatically see the stream. If it is easier to implement, it could also be done via two websites (one sending, one receiving website). Do what makes sense.

As it is used as a baby-monitor the communication should be "real-time". 

The screen must be kept on until the website is closed for both.

blink screen black and white if there are loud sounds

blink screen red and black on disconnect of any kind

background of the screen should be green if connection established between two devices 

no data should be stored
